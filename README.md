# Diataxis Writing Exercise
I recently learned about the [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/) approach to writing documentation and performed an exercise to get my mind around how to think about it. This exercise is an attempt to document heat mechanics in the game [Oxygen Not Included](https://www.klei.com/games/oxygen-not-included) by Klei Entertainment. I felt this worked as a good exercise because it involves (mostly) realistic technical concepts such as specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity, and because I had effectively spent a lot of time researching these concepts through my playtime. This is the sort of thing that's within the wheelhouse of a technical writer.

Documentation set: [Heat Management in Oxygen Not Included](https://brownerikc.github.io/ONIdiataxis/HeatManagement.html)

## Topic Types Marked
For the purposes of exercise, I explicitly noted the type of each topic and categorized them in navigation. If this was more formal documentation, I would consider different headers and organization to be less prescriptive.

## Work in Progress
What's here can be considered an MVP. I still have a topic or two I want to add, and the HTML/CSS/JavaScript is essentially "just enough" to present content. I want to clean that up further.

## Generative AI
Portions of the HTML and JavaScript were created with generative AI or built upon those AI outputs. You can reasonably assume any ugly or clunky parts are from the AI.

All text was written by me. AI did not touch any of that.
